/**
 * A very simple and basic implementation of streams, providing
 * some of the functions of stream from Java 8.
 * <p>
 * Many methods are missing and some additional are provided: this
 * is not intended as a full replacement. When a method exists with
 * the same name as provided by Java 8 streams, then it has the
 * same signature and aims to be compatible.
 * <p>
 * There is no special optimization besides that the streams are
 * lazy fetching. Parallelism is not supported.
